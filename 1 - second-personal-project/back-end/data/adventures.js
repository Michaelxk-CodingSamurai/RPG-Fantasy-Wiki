        description: '"Middle-earth", or Endor in Quenya (Ennor in Sindarin) - and in The Book of Lost Tales the Great Lands - are the names used for the habitable parts of Arda after the final ruin of Beleriand, east across the Belegaer from Aman. This continent was north of the Hither Lands shown in the Ambarkanta, and west of the East Sea; and throughout the First and Second Ages it underwent dramatic geographical changes, caused by Iluvatar.',

        description: "Situated upon a massive protrusion of rock, the walls and castles of Lothric are a testament to its former glory and mightiness. However, upon the Ashen One's arrival, the kingdom is in apparent ruin: Virtually all of the inhabitants have reduced to Hollows, and the courtyards and castle pathways are littered with the remains of deceased knights and soldiers, indicating a great battle had taken place in the past. The few that remain have gone Hollow and are immediately hostile to the player. The kingdom is also suffering from an infestation of Pus of Man.",

        description: "Even as their ancient civilisation now lies buried beneath the sand, its once verdant plains turned to searing desert and their mighty and glorious empire fractured and in ruin, the Tomb Kings have once more awoken from their deep sleep. Rising from their decrepit sarcophagi, the mummified rulers of Nehekhara awoke with eyes of burning balefire, their thirst for power, conquest and vengeance just as strong in death as in life. They have returned to reclaim that which is rightfully theirs, their legions innumerable, rising up from the scorching sand brandishing weapons of polished bronze and priceless gold. Ancient, emotionless and spiteful to all those that have slighted them, woe betide those foolish enough to stand before their silent onslaught.",
